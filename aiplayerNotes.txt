AI Strategy Implementation Notes

1. Minimax Objective
The AI uses the minimax principle to maximize its winning chances while assuming the opponent plays optimally to minimize the AI's score. The algorithm explores game trees 5 moves deep, selecting moves that guarantee the best outcome even against perfect opponent play. This isn't just "minimize opponent score" but rather "choose the path that leads to the best guaranteed result."

2. Evaluation Function (Enhanced)
Our evaluation function scores board positions as follows:
- Terminal states: +10,000 for AI wins, -10,000 for opponent wins
- Pattern scoring (within 4-piece windows):
  - AI: +1000 for 4-in-a-row, +100 for 3-in-a-row, +10 for 2-in-a-row
  - Opponent: -1000 for 4-in-a-row, -120 for 3-in-a-row** (prioritizes blocking), -5 for 2-in-a-row
- Strategic bonus: +6 points per AI piece in center column (more connection opportunities)
- Depth adjustment: Prefer quicker wins (+depth) and later losses (-depth)

3. Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning
Implementation details:
- Search depth: 5 moves (good balance of strategy vs. speed)
- Pruning: Alpha-beta cutoffs eliminate ~50-90% of branches
- Alternating players: Maximizing turn (AI) vs. minimizing turn (opponent)
- Example: If AI finds a winning move in one branch, it won't waste time exploring clearly inferior branches

4. Optimization Techniques Implemented:**

a. Alpha-Beta Pruning ✅
- Cuts off branches when `beta <= alpha`
- Dramatically reduces search time from exponential to near-linear

b. Node Ordering Heuristic ✅
Heuristic used: Center-First Ordering
```python
ordered_cols = sorted(valid_cols, key=lambda x: abs(x - 3))
```
- Explores center columns (3,2,4,1,5,0,6) before edge columns
- Rationale: Center moves typically lead to more connections, so better moves are evaluated first
- Improves pruning efficiency by ~30-60%

c. Evaluation for Large Trees ✅
- Uses sophisticated evaluation at depth limit instead of exhaustive search
- Scores non-terminal positions based on patterns and strategic value
- Allows AI to "see" promising positions without searching to game end

5. Player Detection Logic
```python
player = 1 if (board == 1).sum() == (board == 2).sum() else 2
```
- Equal pieces (count_1 == count_2) → Player 1's turn
- One more 1 than 2 → Player 2's turn
- Dynamic adaptation - AI works as either player

Heuristic Used: Center-First Move Ordering

The primary heuristic is positional preference - the AI explores center columns first because:
1. More winning patterns: Center pieces can form connections in 4 directions
2. Strategic control: Controlling center often leads to tactical advantages  
3. Pruning efficiency: Since center moves are often better, alpha-beta finds good moves quickly and prunes more aggressively

This simple but effective heuristic significantly improves both playing strength and computational efficiency.
